                     <h1>The Eternal War</h1>
                     <h3>**The Twins**</h3>
                     <p>A history of the first Age of Duckdom by the scribe Quackgustus of the Order of Sirynx and the tale of the brothers Cornelius and Austinius of the Royal family and the House of Ventris. </p>
            
                       <p>It was an age undreamed of, peace had reigned for a thousand years and the Kingdom of Duckdom was the jewel of the world.  Artist, craftsmen and scholars had free reign to explore their skills.  Such was the time that the Royal Army was reduced to only a token force to guard the Royal Palace.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Into this the brothers Cornelius and Austinius were born. Twins, the boys were afforded every luxury and educated by the finest of tutors.  Being the first born, Cornelius was also groomed to one day lead the Kingdom.  Both boys grew to become strong charismatic ducks.  Of the two brothers, Cornelius proved to be the most physical and outgoing.  Reveling in sport and any physical competition.  Austinius on the other hand was frail by comparison but he excelled at his studies and was always hungry for more knowledge and questioned everything around him.</p>
                        
                        <p>Growing into duckhood there became apparent a tension between the two brothers.  Austinius was often heard questioning the law and tradition of the first born son assuming the crown when the old King passed. There were those at court that noticed and listened in quiet, though it was not known if it was in agreement or not.</p>
                        
                        <p>Reaching their majority, the tensions between the two brothers grew. At times they were seen bickering outside the court which began to draw the attention of the common duck.  Growing concerned of the continued strife and how the common ducks would see the discord in the royal house the King took a strong stance and sent Austinius away to the Temple of Halcyon, far away and on the edge of the Kingdoms eastern lands near the blight sea.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3> **Seed of Darkness**                        </h3>
            
                        <p> In the years that followed Austinius consoled himself with his apparent exile by delving the depths of the temples many scrolls.  Through these explorations Austinius found long forgotten catacombs and many forgotten tomes.  In these he discovered that some history seemed not to be what he had been taught as he came across references of famous battles and conflicts that made mention of ducks who wielded arcane powers at the side of their warrior brethren.</p>
            
                          <p>When making mention of this to the Monks of the temple his questions were laughed away as wives tales and fanciful embellishment by the tomes authors.  Not deterred, Austinius continued his explorations determined to find the truth of the matter himself.  It was a few short months later that he discovered a unnamed tome in the farthest reaches of the catacombs that he had traveled.  It was in these pages that Austinius found the teachings of the Mad Monk and exercised that would allow a duck to draw upon the arcane power within themselves.</p> 
                           
                          <p>   Austinius began to practice these teachings in secret and was astounded that he was able to recreate some of the effects described within the tomb.  In the musty pages Austinius also found mention of other tomes and several obscure references to 'The Three'</p>
                        
                           <p> Continuing his explorations, Austinius found several more tomes by the Mad Monk and his control of the arcane energies these teachings gave him access too.  He was able to create fire with a flick of a wing or move an object at will just using his mind.  It was in these latest tomes that Austinius discovered that the 'Three' were powerful beings that were banished to Hell in a war eon's past.
                          </p>
                           <br><br>
                           <h3>**The Ties that Bind**</h3>
                           <p>And so it was that six years after his exile, Austinius strode forth from the temple.  The black gates closed silently behind him and a darkness embraced the temple that remains to this day.</p>
            
                           <p>             Making his way across the land he gathered unto himself a small host of ducks.  These he began to teach the mysteries of power that He had begun to learn and they became known as the Disciples and they in turn began to teach other ducks as well.</p>
                 
                              
                             <p> Word of Austinius's travels spread and on the day that he reached the Capitol His father the King greeted him with open if chilly grace.  Retiring to the castle Austinius demonstrated and explained what he had discovered, asking why such knowledge had been suppressed.  Thus did a great debate begin as the learned ducks of the court and the Kings advisors spoke of the ancient histories, The Great Purge and the Binding of the Three and the decision then made to let such knowledge fade from the land to prevent another great war which may destroy Duckdom.</p>
                              <br><br>
                              <h3>**Path to Hell**</h3>
                              <p>History would record the Great debate as the begining of the great war and the destrcution that would follow.  Austinius continued to argue for the use of these powers and the great works Duckdom could accomplish with them.  Not heeding the warnings of the Kings councile that the power would corrupt any that weild it.  Austinius argued that Ducks of this age were wiser and more suited to wielding such engergies.</p>
            
                                <p>Growing weary of the debate the King declared that no duck should practice the use of these sorcerous energies and that any caught would be sumerarily executed.  Enraged by his fathers decicion Austinius lashed out, his power engulfing the councile chamaber and those there.</p> 
                                 
                                 <p>As his burst of rage subsided Ausitinius realized he had mortally wounded his father the King.  Cornelius rushed to his fathers side as Austinius looked on in shock.  Holding his father to him, Cornelius watched as the life seaped from the old King.  With a quiet whisper the King uttered his last works, 'Stop him'.</p>
                                 
                                 <p>It was then that Austinius realized what he had done and fled from the councile chamber as his brothers cry of loss echoed through the castle.  Fleeing the capitol Ausinius and his Diciples fled back to the great Temple of Halcyon.</p>
                                 <br>

                                 that led to terror’s breast. I have plumbed the depths of
                                 Hatred’s womb and scaled Destruction’s crest.</p>

                                 I’d sell the remnants of my soul, regardless how it burned.
                                 And still I sought a higher wisdom few could have attained.
                                 ‘Though I found it, it would leave me - broken, damned and drained.</p> 
                                 
                                 <p>For now I find this power gained is more unto a curse.
                                    My spirit burns with every spell and each irreverent verse.
                                    Despite this strength and knowledge earned, I have paid a heavy toll,
                                    Never should’ve traded power for my own immortal soul.”

                                 <h3> **The Eternal War**</h3>
                                 <p>It was then that Cornelius laid his father the King to rest and assumed his mantle as the King of Duckdom.  With a heavy heart Cornelius doned his armor and called to his side the Royal Guard, vowing to bring his brother back to face justice for what he had done.</p>
            
                                    <p>And so the Royal host set forth to bring Austinius to justice.  The Diciples blocked the path forward at every turn, assaulting the Royal guard and sending forth nightmares summoned forth from the nether by their mystic powers. </p> 
                                    
                                   <p>Never to be detered, Cornelius and the Royal Guard pushed foward, leaving behind a bloody road of dead Diciples and fallen guards until at last they had faught their way to the black gates of the Temple of Hayclon.</p> 
                                    
                                   <p>Calling out for his brother to end the madness and destruction Cornelius and the Royal host prepaired themselves.  At last the black gates swung open and Austinius strode forth with a host never before seen in Duckdom.</p> 
                                    
                                    <p>Behind him a host of twisted and deformed ducks pored from the black gate as if ripped from the mouth of hell.  History has long lost who struck the first blow but a great battle did erupt between the hosts of Cornelius and his brother Austinius.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>At the last Cornelius was able to fight his way through the hellish hord and confronted his brother.  None remain that can recall the fight but all remember the aftermath.  A great explosion of energies ripped through the two hosts, tearing them and the Temple of Hayclon apart.  Leaving behind a gaping cavern forever alight in hellish flames.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Thus it was that the Eternal War began.  Out of the cavern now known as Austinius's Maw a host of Hell ducks would swarm seeking to enslave the lands as a host of the Royal Army stood fast to block their path.</p>

                                    ***

                                    <h3>**Hell hath no fury like a Brother scorned**
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>Austinius' Maw had blazed for three months and still there was no sign of the hellish fires abating.  The fires burned so hot that no duck could come within a thousand feet of the Maw's entrance without fearing their feathers would ignite from the extreme heat.</p>
            
                                      <p> King Cornelius and the Royal Army set outposts to watch the Maw and returned to the capitol thinking and hoping that everything would begin to return to normal for all ducks.</p>
                                       
                                     <p>  Unimaginable screams echoed through the cavern as Austinius sat upon a stone thrown watching the seven vats that held his most trusted warriors.  Within each a vague form wreathed in noxious vapors, barely recognizable as a duck, while archane glyphs glowed along the sides of the vats. </p>
                                    
                                     <p>  Picking up his staff, Austinius leaned heavily on it as he moved from the thrown to the vats, his broken body shuddering in agony.  Stopping near the middle vat he reached out his hand and began chanting, his voice harsh with hatered.  A sickly green glow enveloped each vat and with a final shriek each exploded, depositing a duck at his feet.</p>
            
                                      <p> The first to stand was an immaculate specimen of a duck, a smile playing along his beak as he watched Austinius.  The second arose, his feathers seemingly dipped in gold.  The third was a lady duck, her figure shifting slightly so all who looked saw thier own desire.  The fourth duck looked at his brothers and sister with much longing, while the fifth was gaunt to the point of being skelletal.  Next were to opposites, the first being the epitome of physical expresion for a duck but marred by a vicious snarl as the last was obese beyond immagining.</p>
                                    
                                       <p>With soft whipsers Austinius spoke to each, his words the silent hiss of a snake slithering in the grass.  Each of the seven bowed to Austinius and left the great cavern as the mage sat back upon his thrown.</p>
            
                                      <p> In the dead of night the Seven escaped from the maw, unseen by any of the sentries King Cornilius had set and thus the Seven deadly Sins were unleash upon the world as the first step of Austinius's revenge against his brother. </p>
                                    
                                       <p>Now full of miseries, the Kingdom would change the course of the heavens by the decree of fate...
