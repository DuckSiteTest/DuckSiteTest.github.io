                     <p>In the year 1620 King Adan Quackson convened a conclave
                        of his children, Princes Cain and Abel and the main
                        members of the clergy to let them know his vision of
                        the world.
                        <br><br>
                        He wanted a more egalitarian society, where "a duck is
                        always a duck” regardless of the social stratum to which
                        they belong. It was clear to him however that he no longe
                        had the necessary strength to carry out that vision.
                        <br><br>
                        King Adan decided to take the next few days to choose his
                        successor.
                        In an attempt to achieve his father's approval and be the
                        chosen one, Abel, who was a shepherd, offered him the
                        firstborn of his flock.

                     <p>Cain, jealous of his brother's actions, decided to visit
                        his father in the castle and bring him wine, the fruit
                        of his land. While tasting the wine, King Adan told him
                        that he had met with the cleric to inform them that
                        he had chosen Abel as his successor. <br><br>
                        With tears in their eyes, King Adan and his son Cain
                        embraced, emotionally hugging one another. <br><br>
                        The next day King Adan was found dead, his heart
                        having stopped beating only a few short minutes
                        after Cain left the castle.

                     <p>The day before the coronation, Abel received a visit
                        from Josimar Duckinoff, a simple peasant smelling of
                        the land he tills and feathers worn close to the quill.
                        He arrived tired and desperately asked to speak
                        with Abel.<br><br>
                        Abel gives him the floor, as he listens his brows furrow
                        and face becomes more flush with each word that falls
                        upon his ears.<br><br>
                        Surprised, he couldn't believe what Josimar was telling
                        him, the betrayal of his own flesh and blood! When Abel
                        managed to confirm the peasant's sayings, he ordered
                        the Royal Army to go out in search of his brother Cain
                        and all those who betrayed the crown.

                     <p>Cain, angered and displeased with his late fathers
                        choice, planned to raise a rebellion of about 700
                        ducks from the town and take the kingdom for
                        himself by force. <br><br>
                        Finally, the Royal Army found Cain and the rest of
                        the traitors from town. Under King Abel's order they
                        decided to send the traitors to the furnace, including 
                        his own brother Cain among them.<br><br>
                        Before succumbing to the scorching flames, Cain
                        swore to those who shouted and stood against him
                        that he would return and take revenge.

                     <p>Due to the gruesome method of execution chosen by Abel,
                        the souls of Cain and the roughly 700 traitors were
                        trapped in the underworld. It is here where they continue
                        to torment the ducks and promise revenge. <br><br>
                        Abel defied the request of his father King Adan whose
                        vision was “a duck is always a duck”. Thus it became a
                        society divided into social strata where royal traditions
                        such as races and jousts were born and are still
                        respected to this day.

                        Measles and Malaria, but there was one in
                        particular that had the whole kingdom worried, the
                        green plague! <br> <br>
                        With its epicenter in Duckshire, more and more
                        ducks were getting infected and waking up with a
                        resplendent bright green color all over
                        their bodies.

                     <p>After a while, and seeing that children also suffered
                        from the disease, the King ordered Duckshire to be
                        evacuated. The area was fenced off so that no one else
                        would settle in the surroundings and thus prevent
                        its spread.<br><br>
                        It was a quiet spring in the pond when suddenly the
                        worst happened… the firstborn of the ducks began to
                        disappear…at first it was 1…then 5, eventually leading
                        to hundreds. Cain had kept his promise. Chaos was
                        beginning to take over the pond.

                        procreation by 50%, while others decided to go
                        on vacation in search of peace of mind. <br><br>
                        Amidst the chaos, King Abel decided to form the

                     <p>During the winter of 1642, the scientist Duck Pascal
                        received an assignment. He was tasked to develop a
                        curious flying device and was given a letter that he
                        had to hide inside the equipment.<br><br>
                        Pascal created 3 devices that were used to travel
                        wherever one wanted.<br><br>
                        One morning the 3 took off for their respective
                        destinations but one of them never arrived. The search
                        was incessant but they could never find him. Some
                        consider him dead and blame Cain for his
                        disappearance, others claim that he communicates
                        from beyond.
