                      <p>In the year 1620 King Adan Quackson convened a conclave
                        of his children, Princes Cain and Abel and the main
                        members of the clergy to let them know his vision of
                        the world.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        He wanted a more egalitarian society, where "a duck is
                        always a duck” regardless of the social stratum to which
                        they belong. It was clear to him however that he no longe
                        had the necessary strength to carry out that vision.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        King Adan decided to take the next few days to choose his
                        successor.
                        In an attempt to achieve his father's approval and be the
                        chosen one, Abel, who was a shepherd, offered him the
                        firstborn of his flock.</p>

                   <p>Cain, jealous of his brother's actions, decided to visit
his father in the castle and bring him wine, the fruit
of his land. While tasting the wine, King Adan told him
that he had met with the cleric to inform them that
he had chosen Abel as his successor. <br><br>

With tears in their eyes, King Adan and his son Cain
embraced, emotionally hugging one another. <br><br>

The next day King Adan was found dead, his heart
having stopped beating only a few short minutes
after Cain left the castle.</p>

                        <p>The day before the coronation, Abel received a visit
                            from Josimar Duckinoff, a simple peasant smelling of
                            the land he tills and feathers worn close to the quill.
                            He arrived tired and desperately asked to speak
                            with Abel.<br><br>
                            
                            Abel gives him the floor, as he listens his brows furrow
                            and face becomes more flush with each word that falls
                            upon his ears.<br><br>
                            
                            Surprised, he couldn't believe what Josimar was telling
                            him, the betrayal of his own flesh and blood! When Abel
                            managed to confirm the peasant's sayings, he ordered
                            the Royal Army to go out in search of his brother Cain
                            and all those who betrayed the crown.</p>

                    <div class="col-sm-6 ">
                   <p>Cain, angered and displeased with his late fathers
                    choice, planned to raise a rebellion of about 700
                    ducks from the town and take the kingdom for
                    himself by force. <br><br>
                    
                    Finally, the Royal Army found Cain and the rest of
                    the traitors from town. Under King Abel's order they
                    decided to send the traitors to the furnace, including 
                    his own brother Cain among them.<br><br>
                    
                    Before succumbing to the scorching flames, Cain
                    swore to those who shouted and stood against him
                    that he would return and take revenge.</p>

                            trapped in the underworld. It is here where they continue
                            to torment the ducks and promise revenge. <br><br>
                            
                            Abel defied the request of his father King Adan whose
                            vision was “a duck is always a duck”. Thus it became a
                            society divided into social strata where royal traditions
                            such as races and jousts were born and are still
                            respected to this day.</p>

                    With its epicenter in Duckshire, more and more

                            evacuated. The area was fenced off so that no one else
                            would settle in the surroundings and thus prevent

                            to hundreds. Cain had kept his promise. Chaos was

                        <p>During the winter of 1642, the scientist Duck Pascal
                            received an assignment. He was tasked to develop a
                            curious flying device and was given a letter that he
                            had to hide inside the equipment.<br><br>

                            was incessant but they could never find him. Some
